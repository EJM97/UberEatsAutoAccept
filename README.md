# UberEatsAutoAccept
App to auto accept Uber Driver app delivery orders (Tested with Uber Eats and Uber Package deliveries only).

Disclaimer: This app has no affiliation with uber and was only built for educaional purposes and to make the acceptance process of Uber Eats deliveries easier for myself by not havving to touch the phone while driving / not having to stop the vehicle to accept a delivery. I do not gurantee that it would work as expected, and am not responsible if the app doesn't work as expected and causes the driver to be distracted by app not working as expected or if Uber decides to terminate your access to uber driver app for using a 3rd party app to emulate touches or by having to unassign too many deliveries which cannot be completed or due to any other reason. Use at your own Risk!

##Info:
App is built using Tasker with AutoInput addon.


##How to use?
App has no UI, clicking the app will make it run in the background, go online in uber driver app and orders should be accepted if no action is taken within 2 seconds. 
NOTE: Uber Driver app must be in Foreground.
To stop the app you have to force stop the app.
